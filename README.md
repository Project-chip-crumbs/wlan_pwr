## Introduction

The [CHIP](http://getchip.com/) single-board computer has built-in WIFI hardware.
Linux can put the WIFI hardware into different power modes, presumably to reduce electrical consumption.
But many have reported problems with CHIP's WIFI, especially performance, and occasionally reliability.
I have seen CHIP unable to complete an "apt-get update" with power management turned on.

Fortunately, it is easy to turn off the power management with a simple command:
    sudo iwconfig wlan0 power off

Unfortunately, with CHIP's current OS, that setting is not remembered across reboots.  So the next
time you boot CHIP, power management will be back on.

The "wlan_pwr" script is designed to be run during system startup, and turns power management off
as the interface is brought up.

You can find wlan_pwr on github.  See:

* User documentation (this README): https://github.com/fordsfords/wlan_pwr/tree/gh-pages

Note: the "gh-pages" branch is considered to be the current stable release.  The "master" branch is the development cutting edge.

## Quick Start

These instructions assume you are in a shell prompt on CHIP.

1. Get the prerequisit Linux package.

        sudo apt-get install wireless-tools

2. Verify that power management is turned on:

        /sbin/iwconfig wlan0

    You should see the line:

        Power Management:on

3. Get the shell script file onto CHIP and reboot:

        sudo wget -O/etc/network/if-up.d/wlan_pwr http://fordsfords.github.io/wlan_pwr/wlan_pwr
        sudo chmod +x /etc/network/if-up.d/wlan_pwr
        sudo shutdown -r now

4. Test the package.  Wait for CHIP to finish booting, and log back in.  Then:

        /sbin/iwconfig wlan0

    You should see the line:

        Power Management:off
